A website for visiting Oslo Musem. Oslo Museum is where weâ€™re committed to making science accessible to all.
The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and
perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.


## Description

Oslo Museum is a project that is built up from using HTML & CSS. Main goal of this project is to use my skills to create a website
that looks good-ish. Important part about this project is that you can browse around the pages and look for the information that you intrested in. This was created as
a part of a school assignment that puts our HTML and CSS skills to test. Before coding i've used Figma to desing the project on how i want it too look like.
